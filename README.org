* Aim
  The aim of this project is to construct a hand-held chorded keyboard with
  chords inspired by the Twiddler-2.1 but using two-switches per finger rather
  than three with the third being emulated by pressing the two simultaneously.
* Images
  Here is the current version of the DecaKeyer fabricated in
  [[http://www.polymorphplastic.co.uk/][Polymorph]] (known as Friendly Plastic
  in the US)
  [[https://github.com/Henry/DecaKeyer/raw/master/Images/DecaKeyer.jpg]]
  and as it looks when worn

* Teensy 2 Software
  The [[https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/][Teensy-2.0]] micro-controller is used in
  this project.  The installation notes are really for my own reference but they
  may be useful to others.  I am developing software under OpenSuSE but all
  these tools are available for other GNU/Linux distributions.
*** Install AVR tools on OpenSuSE
    Open /firefox/ and follow instructions on
    + http://software.opensuse.org/package/cross-avr-gcc
    + Use the 1-click install of /CrossToolchain:avr/
    Or add the repository and use =zypper=
    + sudo zypper addrepo http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/CrossToolchain:/avr/openSUSE_13.1/
    + =zypper in cross-avr-gcc avr-libc cross-avr-binutils=
*** CLI Loader (used instead of Teensyduino)
    Download the latest CLI app for teensy-2
    + =wget https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/teensy_loader_cli.2.1.zip=
    + =unzip teensy_loader_cli.2.1.zip=
    + =cd teensy_loader_cli=
    + =make=
    + Install somewhere in your =PATH= /eg/: =cp teensy_loader_cli ~/bin/linux=
